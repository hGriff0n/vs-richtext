# vs-richtext

Richtext is a small and simple extension I whipped up while working on an essay for a college "History of Science" class.

This simple extension aims to simplify the creative process when typing out essays and other writings, especially in the initial "thought" stages, by allowing for the usage of "comments" within the writing style. vs-richtext highlights all c-style comments within the text file, allowing the writer to more easily distinguish between the "final" text and the collection internal thoughts and improvements.

vs-richtext also provides further highlighting help in the case of "todo" comments, specially highlighting the "todo" in a brigher shade. Note, though, that this highlighting only occurs if "todo:" or "TODO:" is the first non-space character string within the commment.
