vs-richtext

vs-richtext is a small and simple extension I whipped up while working on an essay for a "History of Science" class.

This simple extension tries to simplify the creative process for typing out essays and other writings by allowing
for the usage of "comments". vs-richtext highlights all c-style comments within the text file to allow the writer
to more easily distinguish between the "final" text and the internal thoughts and improvements.

vs-richtext also provides a further highlighting help in the case of "todo" comments, specially highlighting the
"todo" in a slightly different shade. This highlighting only occurs if "todo:" or "TODO:" is the first non-space
character string within the commment.
